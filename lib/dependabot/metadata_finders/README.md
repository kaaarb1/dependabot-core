# Metadata finders

Metadata finders look up metadata about a dependency, such as its GitHub URL.

There is a `Dependabot::MetadataFinders` class for each language Dependabot
supports.

## Public API

Each `Dependabot::MetadataFinders` class implements the following methods:

| Method           | Description                                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#source_url`    | A link to the source data for the dependency.                                               |
| `#commits_url`   | A link to a commit diff between the previous version of the dependency and the new version. |
| `#changelog_url` | A link to the changelog for the dependency.                                                 |
| `#release_url`   | A link to the release notes for this version of the dependency.                             |

An integration might look as follows:

```ruby
require 'dependabot/metadata_finders'

dependency = update_checker.updated_dependency

metadata_finder_class = Dependabot::MetadataFinders::Ruby::Bundler
metadata_finder = metadata_finder_class.new(
  dependency: dependency,
  credentials: credentials
)

puts "Changelog for #{dependency.name} is at #{metadata_finder.changelog_url}"
```

## Writing a metadata finder for a new language

All new metadata finders should inherit from `Dependabot::MetadataFinders::Base`
and implement the following methods:

| Method                 | Description             |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| `#look_up_source`      | Private method that returns a hash with the keys `"host"` and `"repo"` (e.g,. `{ "host" => "github", "repo" => "dependabot/dependabot-core" }`). Generally these are extracted from a source code URL provided by the language's dependency registry. |

To ensure the above are implemented, you should include
`it_behaves_like "a dependency metadata finder"` in your specs for the new
metadata finder.
